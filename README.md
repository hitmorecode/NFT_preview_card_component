## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This challenge was a good way to practice using flexbox and position.
Using flexbox and position is very useful once you understand the basics of these concepts.

### Continued development

Using flexbox and position was not so easy to start with, since I'm still new with these concepts. I'll be focusing on these subjects for the coming challenges.

The challenge was to create a NFT card, but I added three more cards to start practicing responsiveness.
